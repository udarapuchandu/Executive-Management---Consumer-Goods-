ðŸŒŸ Problem Statement ðŸŒŸ Atliq Hardware, a top computer hardware manufacturer in India and beyond, faces challenges in making quick, data-driven decisions. To strengthen their data analytics team, Tony Sharma, Head of Data Analytics, has designed a SQL challenge to evaluate candidates' technical and communication skills.

ðŸŒŸ Tools & Approach ðŸŒŸ I used a range of tools and techniques to tackle this challenge effectively:

MySQL: Leveraged advanced SQL concepts, including Joins, CTEs, Subqueries and more, to extract valuable insights.

Power BI: Created engaging visualizations like Bar Charts, Line Charts, Maps, and Donut Charts while utilizing DAX for deeper analysis.

Canva : Designed visually appealing presentations with refined themes, color corrections, and image enhancements.

ðŸŒŸ Insights & Recommendations ðŸŒŸ

Key Insights: Metrics such as Gross Profit, Contribution %, Top Orders by Sales, Average Gross Sales, and Manufacturing Costs.

Proposed Solutions: Boost production by introducing initiatives like memberships, gift vouchers, bundled offers, student discounts, and other attractive promotions to enhance customer engagement and sales.
